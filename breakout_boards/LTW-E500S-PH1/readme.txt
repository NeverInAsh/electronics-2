A breakout board for the SMD RGB LED LTW-E500S-PH1 from LiteOn.

This is a single layer layout, with a 4 pin header as connector.

Part list:

D1	LTW-E500S-PH1 SMD RGB LED
R1	SMD resistor 91 Ohms in 1206 package
R2	SMD resistor 56 Ohms in 1206 package
R3	SMD resistor 82 Ohms in 1206 package
K1	1x4 pin header

The original LED from LiteOn is not available anymore, but the
Full-Color SMD LED CLP6C-FKB from Cree works as a replacement.
Unfortunately the red and green pins are swapped. Changed part list:

D1	CLP6C-FKB PLCC6 RGB SMD LED
R1	SMD resistor 90 Ohms in 1206 package
R2	SMD resistor 150 Ohms in 1206 package
R3	SMD resistor 90 Ohms in 1206 package
